Homework Assignment #4: Control Flow

Details:
 

You're about to do an assignment called "Fizz Buzz", which is one of the classic programming challenges. It is a favorite for interviewers, and a shocking number 
of job-applicants can't get it right. But you won't be one of those people. Here are the rules for the assignment (as specified by Imran Gory):

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The one hint you'll likely need is: 

There is a Kotlin operator called "rem" but often referred to as "modulus" or "modulo", and it gives you the remainder left over after division. The rem operator
 is useful for finding out if X is a multiple of Y. Knowing this should help you complete this assignment without any issue.


Extra Credit:

Instead of only printing "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz", add a fourth print statement: "prime". You should print this whenever you encounter a number that is prime 
(divisible only by itself and one). As you implement this, don't worry about the efficiency of the algorithm you use to check for primes. It's okay for it to be slow.
